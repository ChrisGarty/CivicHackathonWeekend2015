Pedestrian & Traffic Counter
=========================

In this repo we have both pedestrian data for the 100th block on Broadway (2014 and up to 2015),
and traffic turning counts for various intersections downtown.

[There is also a report from 2013](http://www.fmmetrocog.org/new/assets/documents/Traffic%20and%20Bike-Ped%20Counts/2013%20Bike-Ped%20Counts/2013%20BP%20Count%20Report%20-%20Final.pdf)

The turn data comes from part of the ND DOT surveys. The complete data
is available online, although I can't figure out how to download from
there. http://gis.dot.nd.gov/external/ge_html/?viewer=transinfo
