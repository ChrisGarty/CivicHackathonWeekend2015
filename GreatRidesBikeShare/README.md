See <readme> for more info on the data sets.

Here are some ideas from Aaron:

I'd challenge hackers to help us with a few questions:
- How can we use ridership patterns to help balance the location of bikes over time? We can transport only a few bikes at a time from station to station, and it's all done with another bike trailer and is a time-intensive process.
- How can we use ridership patterns to help dictate station size and expansion? It's a fairly easy process to move docks from one station to another if need be.
- How can we use ridership patterns (along with other types of civic data) to determine where to build additional stations? We want to address rider needs but also consider that careful location choice might enhance our ability to find sponsors to help fund new stations.

This program has been a game-changer in how people get around. I challenge hackers to find new ways to use this data to help our riders and community as a whole.

Hackers might ask if there is a live API for the data. We do have one, but it's for internal use only right now. I'd consider a public release if there's enough demand.

Happy hacking!
